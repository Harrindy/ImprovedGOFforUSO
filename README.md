# A more powerful goodness-of-fit test for uniform stochastic ordering
This repository contains R programs for the article, “A more powerful goodness-of-fit test for uniform stochastic ordering,” by Dewei Wang and others. This article has been submitted to the Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics for publication.

Prior to using R programs on this repository, please install R package "TestUSO" using the following commands:
    library(devtools);
    install_github("Harrindy/TestUSO")

To reproduce our simulation results: Download the files Curves.R and Simulation.R to your computer. Open R (or Rstudio) and run Simulation.R. Make sure that R package "TestUSO" has been installed and R (or Rstudio) can access the R file Curves.R.
